# RabbitMQ Examples.

Here are two rather simple examples about some ways that RabbitMQ can be used.

The projects are pretty much ready to run without any modifications.

This demo consists of:
1. A "peer-to-peer" chat, where multiple users can connect and talk to each other;
2. A "microservices" environment where several microservices can be launched to perform tasks, and a monitor that constantly checks and updates the status of each microservice and can be queried by a user about the states of the monitored microservices.

However, RabbitMQ can be used for much more advanced applications, and there are some official RabbitMQ tutorials that show all the kinds of exchanges and different ways to use them on their official website, if you want to learn more: https://www.rabbitmq.com/getstarted.html
